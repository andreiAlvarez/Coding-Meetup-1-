# Coding-Meetup-1-

You will be given an array of objects (hashes in ruby) representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the coding meetup that you are organising for the first time.

Your task is to return the number of JavaScript developers coming from Europe.

If, there are no JavaScript developers from Europe then your function should return 0.

Notes:

The format of the strings will always be Europe and JavaScript.
All data will always be valid and uniform as in the example above.


# Coding Meetup #2

You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP) representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

Your task is to return an array where each object will have a new property 'greeting' with the following string value:

Hi < firstName here >, what do you like the most about < language here >?

Notes:

The order of the properties in the objects does not matter.
The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.
